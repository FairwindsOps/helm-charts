# RBAC Manager

[RBAC Manager](https://reactiveops.github.io/rbac-manager/) was designed to simplify authorization in Kubernetes. This is an operator that supports declarative configuration for RBAC with new custom resources. Instead of managing role bindings or service accounts directly, you can specify a desired state and RBAC Manager will make the necessary changes to achieve that state.

This project has three main goals:

1. Provide a declarative approach to RBAC that is more approachable and scalable.
2. Reduce the amount of configuration required for great auth.
3. Enable automation of RBAC configuration updates with CI/CD.
